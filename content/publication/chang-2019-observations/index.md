abstract: Oceanic vortex evolution on the lee side of Taiwan’s Green Island (~7 km in diameter), where the Kuroshio flows at a speed of 1–1.5 m s−1, is observationally examined and compared to theories and the preceding results of laboratory experiments. In the near wake, recirculation occurs with a relative vorticity of ζ ~ 20f (where f is the planetary vorticity) and subsequently sheds at a combination of periods resulting from the tidal oscillations and the intrinsic time scale of eddy evolution. The tidal oscillations are the predominant processes. Our analysis suggests that an island positioned in the Kuroshio with periodic and cross-stream tidal excursions is analogous to a cross-stream oscillating cylinder. Consequently, the shedding period of the vortex is synchronized to a tidal period occurring close to the intrinsic period. The free shear layer, which is characterized by an ~30f relative vorticity band (2 km wide) and a wavy thermal front, develops between the Kuroshio and recirculation. The frontal wave occurring over a time period of 0.5–2 h resembles Kelvin–Helmholtz instability corresponding to high Re values. For the far wake, repeated cross-wake surveys suggest that cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices are alternatively present at a period close to the period of M2 tides in agreement with near-wake measurements. Repeated along-wake surveys reveal a cyclonic eddy shedding downstream at a speed of 0.35 m s−1, 1/3 of the upstream current speed, from the near wake. In comparing our observations with the results of previous water tank experiments, an Re value of O(103) for the submesoscale wake regime is expected.
