I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Earth System Science at University of California, Irvine. 
My research interests involve stratified shear instability's role in ocean mixing. I am also interested in flow-topography interactions, such as internal tide-driven mixing at ocean bottom, island wakes and flow over ocean ridges. My research aims to address the questions, 'how does turbulence occur in densely-stratified flows? How efficient does mixing occur to homogenize different layers of fluids? What are the effects of turbulent mixing on larger-scale processes?' Using numerical simulations and theories, I aim to understand the complex dynamics of ocean mixing and its impact on the Earth systems.

I have completed my PhD at Oregon State University in 2023, working with [Bill Smyth](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/salty/) on Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence in complex environments. 
Feel free to explore my projects and publications to learn more about my work and contributions to the field.
