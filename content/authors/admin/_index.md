Dr. Chih-Lun Liu is an Assistant Professor in the Institute of Applied Mechanics at National Taiwan University. His research focuses on stratified flows, hydrodynamic instabilities, turbulence, internal waves, environmental and geophysical fluid dynamics, and the development of ocean modeling frameworks. He has extensive experience applying a wide range of fluid dynamics and ocean modeling codes to address complex fluid mechanical problems. 

He earned his Ph.D. from the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University in 2023, working with [Bill Smyth](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/salty/) on Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence in complex environments, followed by
postdoctoral research at the Department of Earth Systems Sciences, University of California, Irvine (2024–2026).  

I am seeking motivated students who are interested in environmental and geophysical fluid dynamics, computational models or turbulence. 
Feel free to explore my projects and publications to learn more about my work and contributions to the field.
